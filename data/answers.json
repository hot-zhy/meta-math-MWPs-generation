If one row and one column are added to form a larger square array, $26$ more students are needed. Find the number of students in Year 4. \n\n### Response: Let's think step by step.\nWe know that the square array has a surplus of 5 students, so the number of students in each row and column is a multiple of 5.\nLet's assume that the number of students in each row and column is 5n, where n is a positive integer.\nWhen one row and one column are added, the total number of students becomes 5n + 26.\nSince the total number of students is the number of students in each row and column multiplied by the number of rows and columns, we have:\n(5n)(5n) + 26 = 5n^2 + 26\nWe also know that the total number of students is the number of students in Year 4, so we have:\n5n^2 + 26 = 5n\n5n^2 - 5n = 26\n5n(n - 1) = 26\nn(n - 1) = 5.3\nn = 1 or n = 2\nSince n must be a positive integer, we have n = 2.\nTherefore, the number of students in Year 4 is 5n = 5(2) = 10.\nThe answer is: 10"

Calculate the amount of profit or loss. \n\n### Response: Let's think step by step.\nThe property owner sold two terraced houses at \uffe1$99000$ each, so the total revenue from selling the houses is 2 * \uffe1$99000 = \uffe1$198000.\nThe profit on one house is 10%, which means the selling price of that house is 100% + 10% = 110% of the original cost.\nSo, the profit on that house is 110% of the original cost, which is 1.1 * original cost.\nThe loss on the other house is 10%, which means the selling price of that house is 100% - 10% = 90% of the original cost.\nSo, the loss on that house is 90% of the original cost, which is 0.9 * original cost.\nTo calculate the overall profit or loss, we need to subtract the loss on the second house from the profit on the first house and subtract that from the total revenue.\nOverall profit = (profit on first house) - (loss on second house) = (1.1 * original cost) - (0.9 * original cost) = 0.2 * original cost.\nOverall profit = 0.2 * original cost = 0.2 * \uffe1$99000 = \uffe1$19800.\nSo, the property owner made a profit of \uffe1$19800.\nThe answer is: 19800"

For every $$15$$ cupcakes, Terry used $$3$$ eggs.  How many eggs did he use altogether? \n\n### Response: Let's think step by step.\nFor every 15 cupcakes, Terry used 3 eggs.\nSo, for 90 cupcakes, Terry used 90/15 = 6 sets of 15 cupcakes.\nTherefore, Terry used 6 sets x 3 eggs = 18 eggs altogether.\n#### 18\nThe answer is: 18"
