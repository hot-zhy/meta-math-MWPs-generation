", "answer": "How many different ways are there to divide $13$ oranges to $3$ kids, to make sure each of them gets at least two oranges? \n\nWe can solve this problem using stars and bars. We have $13$ oranges and $3$ kids, so we need to place $2$ dividers among the $13$ oranges to separate them into $3$ groups. \n\nFor example, if we have $2$ oranges in the first group, $5$ oranges in the second group, and $6$ oranges in the third group, we can represent this arrangement with the dividers as follows: $**|*|**$. \n\nTherefore, the number of different ways to divide the oranges is equivalent to the number of ways to arrange the $2$ dividers among the $13$ oranges, which is $\\binom{13+2}{2} = \\binom{15}{2} = \\boxed{105}$. \n\nThe answer is: 105"}

", "answer": "In $$3$$ years' time, Sally will be $$6$$ times as old as John. Their total age now is $$50$$ years. How old is Sally now? \n\n\n\nLet's solve this problem step by step.\n\nWe know that in 3 years, Sally will be 6 times as old as John. Let's say John's age in 3 years is x. So Sally's age in 3 years will be 6x.\n\nWe also know that their total age now is 50 years. So we can set up the equation:\n\nJohn's age + Sally's age = Total age\n\nJohn's age + 6x = 50\n\nWe also know that their total age now is 50 years. So we can set up another equation:\n\nJohn's age + Sally's age = Total age\n\nJohn's age + Sally's age = 50\n\nNow we have a system of equations:\n\nJohn's age + 6x = 50\n\nJohn's age + Sally's age = 50\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of John's age and Sally's age.\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:\n\n5x = 50 - 50\n\n5x = 0\n\nDividing both sides by 5, we get:\n\nx = 0\n\nSo John's age in 3 years is 0. This means that John is currently 0 years old.\n\nSince Sally's age in 3 years is 6 times John's age in 3 years, Sally's age in 3 years is 6 * 0 = 0.\n\nSo Sally's current age is 0 - 3 = -3 years old.\n\nHowever, we can't have a negative age, so we take the absolute value of -3, which is 3.\n\nTherefore, Sally is currently 3 years old.\n\nThe value of x is 3.The answer is: 3"}

Licia collected three times as many stamps as Krisnam. Imran collected $$138$$ more stamps than Licia. How many stamps did Imran collect? \n\nLicia collected three times as many stamps as Krisnam, so if Krisnam collected X stamps, then Licia collected 3X stamps.\nImran collected 138 more stamps than Licia, so Imran collected 3X + 138 stamps.\nThe total number of stamps collected by all three is X + 3X + (3X + 138) = 2238.\nCombining like terms, we have 7X + 138 = 2238.\nSubtracting 138 from both sides, we have 7X = 2100.\nDividing both sides by 7, we have X = 300.\nTherefore, Krisnam collected 300 stamps, Licia collected 3 * 300 = 900 stamps, and Imran collected 900 + 138 = 1038 stamps.\n#### 1038\nThe answer is: 1038"}

", "answer": "Raja and Kumar had the same amount of money at first. After Raja spent $ $$$$286$$ and Kumar spent $ $$$$109$$, Kumar had $$4$$ times as much money as Raja. How much money did each of them have at first? \nLet's assume that Raja had x dollars at first. \nSince Raja spent $286, he had x - 286 dollars left. \nAfter Kumar spent $109, he had 4(x - 286) = 4x - 1128 dollars left. \nWe know that Kumar had 4 times as much money as Raja, so 4x - 1128 = 4(x - 286). \nExpanding the equation, we get 4x - 1128 = 4x - 1128. \nSimplifying the equation, we get -1128 = -1128. \nSince the equation is true for any value of x, we can conclude that x can be any value. \nTherefore, Raja and Kumar had an unknown amount of money at first. \nThe answer cannot be determined without more information.The answer is: 1128"}

Find the cost of $$1$$ chair. \nThe cost of the table is $160 more than the cost of a chair, so let's assume the cost of a chair is C dollars. \nTherefore, the cost of the table is C + 160 dollars. \nMrs. Lim bought 1 table and 5 chairs for a total of 328 dollars, so we can set up the equation: \nC + 160 + 5C = 328\nCombining like terms, we get:\n6C + 160 = 328\nSubtracting 160 from both sides, we get:\n6C = 168\nDividing both sides by 6, we get:\nC = 28\nSo, the cost of a chair is 28 dollars.\nTherefore, the cost of 1 chair is 28 dollars.\n\nThe cost of 1 chair is 28 dollars.The answer is: 28"}

His brother, Danny, returns from the library at the same time. They meet $$360$$ metres from their house. How fast can Danny walk if the library is $$780$$ metres away from home? \n\nWe can set up a proportion to solve this problem. Let $x$ be the speed at which Danny walks.\n\n$\\frac{x}{780} = \\frac{60}{360}$\n\nCross-multiplying, we get $x \\cdot 360 = 780 \\cdot 60$.\n\nDividing both sides by 360, we find $x = \\frac{780 \\cdot 60}{360} = \\boxed{140}$ meters per minute.\n\nSo, Danny walks at a speed of 140 meters per minute.The answer is: 140"}

How old is Jonathan? \n\nAbigail is currently $6$ years older than Jonathan, so we can write the equation $A = J + 6$, where $A$ represents Abigail's age and $J$ represents Jonathan's age.\n\nSix years ago, Abigail was twice as old as Jonathan, so we can write the equation $A - 6 = 2(J - 6)$.\n\nSimplifying the second equation, we have $A - 6 = 2J - 12$.\n\nSubstituting $A = J + 6$ into the second equation, we have $(J + 6) - 6 = 2J - 12$.\n\nSimplifying further, we have $J = 2J - 18$.\n\nAdding $18$ to both sides of the equation, we have $J + 18 = 2J$.\n\nSubtracting $J$ from both sides of the equation, we have $18 = J$.\n\nTherefore, Jonathan is $\\boxed{18}$ years old.The answer is: 18"}

", "answer": "$3$ apples and $2$ bananas cost~£$1.25$.  $1$ apple and $1$ banana cost~£$0.48$.  Work out how much it would cost to buy $5$ bananas. \n\nWe can set up a system of equations to solve this problem. \nLet $a$ represent the cost of an apple, $b$ represent the cost of a banana, and $c$ represent the cost of a combination of an apple and a banana. \nWe are given the following information: \n$3a + 2b = 125$  (equation 1)\n$a + b = 48$  (equation 2)\nWe want to find the cost of $5$ bananas, which is $5b$. \nWe can solve this problem by substitution or elimination. \nLet's use substitution. \nFrom equation 2, we can express $b$ in terms of $a$ as $b = 48 - a$. \nSubstituting this into equation 1, we get $3a + 2(48 - a) = 125$. \nSimplifying, we get $3a + 96 - 2a = 125$. \nCombining like terms, we get $a + 96 = 125$. \nSubtracting 96 from both sides, we get $a = 29$. \nSubstituting this back into equation 2, we get $b = 48 - 29 = 19$. \nTherefore, the cost of $5$ bananas is $5(19) = \\boxed{95}$. \nThe answer is: 95"}

The shirt costs twice as much as a dress. The difference between the cost of the shirt and the cost of the belt is $$$155$$.

On the second day, he sold all the remaining books at a discount. If the total profit was $80 \\%$ of the planned profit, what would be the discount rate on the second day? \n\nLet's first find the value of the planned profit. Since the total profit was $80 \\%$ of the planned profit, the planned profit was $100 \\%$ of the total profit. So, the planned profit was $80 \\%$ of the total revenue.\n\nLet's say the total revenue from selling all the books was $x$. Then, the planned profit would be $80 \\%$ of $x$, or $0.8x$.\n\nOn the first day, Mike sold $70 \\%$ of his books, which means he sold $0.7x$ books. He earned a profit of $60 \\%$ on these books, which means he earned $0.6(0.7x) = 0.42x$ dollars.\n\nThe remaining books that Mike sold on the second day would be $x - 0.7x = 0.3x$.\n\nLet's say the discount rate on the second day was $d$. The selling price of the remaining books would be $100 \\% - d \\%$, or $1 - \\frac{d}{100}$. The selling price would be $1 - \\frac{d}{100} \\times 0.3x$.\n\nThe total revenue from selling all the books would be the sum of the revenue from selling the first day's books and the revenue from selling the second day's books. This would be $0.42x \\times 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{d}{100} \\times 0.3x\\right) \\times 0.3x$.\n\nWe know that the total profit was $80 \\%$ of the planned profit, so we can set up the equation $0.8x = 0.42x \\times 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{d}{100} \\times 0.3x\\right) \\times 0.3x$.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get $0.8x = 0.42x - \\left(1 - \\frac{d}{100} \\times 0.3x\\right) \\times 0.3x$.\n\nExpanding and simplifying further, we get $0.8x = 0.42x - \\frac{d}{100} \\times 0.06x$.\n\nCombining like terms, we get $0.8x = 0.42x - \\frac{0.06d}{100}x$.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get $0.8x = 0.42x - 0.006dx$.\n\nSubtracting $0.42x$ from both sides, we get $0.8x - 0.42x = -0.006dx$.\n\nSimplifying further, we get $0.38x = -0.006dx$.\n\nDividing both sides by $0.006d$, we get $x = -0.38$.\n\nSince the total revenue cannot be negative, there is no solution for this equation. Therefore, there is no discount rate on the second day that would result in a $80 \\%$ profit.The answer is: 80"}

If $$A$$ puts $$6$$ cookies into each box, she will have $$5$$ cookies left. If $$A$$ puts $$5$$ cookies into each box, she will be short of $$3$$ cookies. How many cookies does $$A$$ have? \nLet's solve this problem using a system of equations. \nLet $$x$$ be the total number of cookies that $$A$$ has. \nWe can set up the following equations based on the given information:\n$$x = 6y + 5$$ (equation 1)\n$$x = 5z + 3$$ (equation 2)\nwhere $$y$$ and $$z$$ represent the number of boxes that $$A$$ puts the cookies into.\nSince we know that $$A$$ has fewer than $$40$$ cookies, we can set up the inequality:\n$$x < 40$$\nSubstituting the equations into the inequality, we get:\n$$6y + 5 < 40$$\n$$5z + 3 < 40$$\nSimplifying the inequalities, we get:\n$$y < 6$$\n$$z < 8$$\nSince $$y$$ and $$z$$ must be integers, the possible values for $$y$$ and $$z$$ are:\n$$y = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$$\n$$z = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$$\nWe can substitute these values into the equations to find the corresponding values of $$x$:\n$$x = 6(1) + 5 = 11$$\n$$x = 5(1) + 3 = 4$$\n$$x = 6(2) + 5 = 17$$\n$$x = 5(2) + 3 = 13$$\n$$x = 6(3) + 5 = 21$$\n$$x = 5(3) + 3 = 18$$\n$$x = 6(4) + 5 = 26$$\n$$x = 5(4) + 3 = 21$$\n$$x = 6(5) + 5 = 31$$\n$$x = 5(5) + 3 = 33$$\nFrom the above calculations, we can see that the only value of $$x$$ that satisfies the inequality $$x < 40$$ and is less than $$40$$ is $$x = 11$.

If he spends £$$78$$ more on food than on donation to charity, how much is his salary? \n\nMike donates $\\frac{1}{4}$ of his salary to charity, so the amount he donates is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of his salary.\nLet's say his salary is $x$. Then the amount he donates is $\\frac{1}{4}x$.\nAfter donating, he has $\\frac{3}{4}x$ remaining.\nHe spends $\\frac{5}{6}$ of the remainder on food, so the amount he spends on food is $\\frac{5}{6}$ of $\\frac{3}{4}x$.\nThe amount he spends on food is $\\frac{5}{6} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4}x = \\frac{15}{24}x$.\nHe saves the rest, which is $\\frac{3}{4}x - \\frac{15}{24}x = \\frac{11}{24}x$.\nWe are given that he spends £78 more on food than on donation to charity.\nSo, we have the equation $\\frac{15}{24}x - \\frac{1}{4}x = 78$.\nCombining like terms, we get $\\frac{11}{24}x = 78$.\nTo solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by $\\frac{24}{11}$.\nThis gives us $x = \\frac{24}{11} \\cdot 78 = 144$.\nTherefore, Mike's salary is £144.The answer is: 144"}

If he wants to put at least $1$ dancing performance between every $2$ playing a sketch, how many different ways are there for him to arrange these performance? \n\nWe can solve this problem using a recursive approach.\nLet $a_n$ be the number of ways to arrange the performances with $n$ dancing performances and $d$ playing a sketch performances.\nConsider the last performance. If there are $d$ playing a sketch performances, then there are $n-d$ dancing performances before it. So, we have $a_{n-d}$ ways to arrange the performances with $n-d$ dancing performances and $d$ playing a sketch performances.\nIf there are $n$ dancing performances, then there are $d$ playing a sketch performances before the first dancing performance. So, we have $a_d$ ways to arrange the performances with $d$ playing a sketch performances.\nTherefore, we have the recursive formula $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_d$.\n\nWe can start with $a_1 = 2$ (either dancing or playing a sketch) and $a_2 = 3$ (two dancing performances and one playing a sketch).\nUsing the recursive formula, we can calculate the values of $a_n$ for $n = 3, 4, \\ldots, 7$:\n\n$a_3 = a_2 + a_1 = 3 + 2 = 5$\n$a_4 = a_3 + a_1 = 5 + 2 = 7$\n$a_5 = a_4 + a_1 = 7 + 2 = 9$\n$a_6 = a_5 + a_1 = 9 + 2 = 11$\n$a_7 = a_6 + a_1 = 11 + 2 = 13$\n\nThe total number of arrangements is $a_7 = 13$.\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{13}$ different ways for Mike to arrange these performances.The answer is: 13"}

Let's use A to represent the number of students in class A and B to represent the number of students in class B.\n\nSo we have: A = 2B\n\nEach student in class A gets $4$ candies, so the total number of candies needed for class A is $4A$.\n\nEach student in class B can get $6$ candies, so the total number of candies needed for class B is $6B$.\n\nWe are given that $20$ more candies are needed for class A, so we can write the equation: $4A + 20 = (4A + 20)$\n\nWe are also given that there will be $16$ candies left after giving out the candies for class A and B, so we can write the equation: $(4A + 6B) - 16 = 0$\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n\n$4A + 20 = 4A + 20$\n\n$4A + 6B - 16 = 0$\n\nSimplifying the first equation, we get: $20 = 20$\n\nSimplifying the second equation, we get: $4A + 6B - 16 = 0$\n\nSince we know that $A = 2B$, we can substitute A in terms of B in the second equation:\n\n$4(2B) + 6B - 16 = 0$\n\n$8B + 6B - 16 = 0$\n\n$14B - 16 = 0$\n\n$14B = 16$\n\n$B = \\frac{16}{14}$\n\nSince B represents the number of students in class B, it must be a whole number.

Eliza sold twice as many cookies as Veron. Betty sold $$185$$ fewer cookies than Eliza. How many cookies did Betty sell? \n\nEliza sold twice as many cookies as Veron, so if we let the number of cookies Veron sold be $x$, then Eliza sold $2x$ cookies.\n\nBetty sold $185$ fewer cookies than Eliza, so Betty sold $2x - 185$ cookies.\n\nThe total number of cookies sold is $855$, so we can write the equation $x + 2x - 185 + x - 185 = 855$.\n\nCombining like terms, we have $4x - 370 = 855$.\n\nAdding $370$ to both sides, we have $4x = 1225$.\n\nDividing both sides by $4$, we have $x = 306$.\n\nTherefore, Betty sold $2x - 185 = 2(306) - 185 = 612 - 185 = \\boxed{427}$ cookies.The answer is: 427"}

", "answer": "65\\%~ ~65\\% of the animals in a farm were cows and the rest were goats. When 240 more cows and goats were added to the farm, the percentage of cows increased by 20\\% and the number of goats doubled. How many goats were there in the farm at first? \n\nLet's solve this problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's determine the percentage of cows in the original farm. We know that 65% of the animals were cows, so the percentage of cows can be calculated as 65/100 * total number of animals.\n\nLet's assume the total number of animals in the original farm is x.\nTherefore, the percentage of cows is 65/100 * x.\n\nNext, let's determine the number of cows in the original farm. We know that 65% of the animals were cows, so the number of cows can be calculated as 65/100 * x.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of goats in the original farm. The remaining animals after accounting for the cows are goats, so the number of goats can be calculated as x - (65/100 * x).\n\nWhen 240 more cows and goats were added to the farm, the percentage of cows increased by 20%. This means the new percentage of cows is 65/100 + 20/100 = 85/100.\n\nLet's determine the new number of cows after the addition. The new percentage of cows is 85/100 * (x + 240).\n\nThe number of goats doubled after the addition. So, the new number of goats is 2 * (x - (65/100 * x)).\n\nNow, let's set up an equation based on the given information.\n\n(65/100 * x) + (85/100 * (x + 240)) = x - (2 * (x - (65/100 * x)))\n\nLet's simplify and solve for x.\n\n65x + 85(x + 240) = x - 2x + 65x\n\n65x + 85x + 20400 = 65x + 240x\n\n350x + 20400 = 300x\n\nTo isolate x, we subtract 300x from both sides of the equation:\n\n350x - 300x + 20400 = 300x - 300x\n\n50x + 20400 = 0\n\nTo solve for x, we subtract 20400 from both sides of the equation:\n\n50x + 20400 - 20400 = 0 - 20400\n\n50x = -20400\n\nFinally, we divide both sides of the equation by 50 to solve for x:\n\nx = -20400 / 50\n\nx = -408\n\nTherefore, there were 408 goats in the farm at first.\n\nThe value of x is -408.\n#### 408\nThe answer is: 408"}

She collected $$ $132$$ for the items she sold. How many T-shirts did Siti have at first? \n\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of T-shirts and caps that Siti had.\nThe ratio of the number of T-shirts to the number of caps is 8:5.\nLet's assume that Siti had 8x T-shirts and 5x caps.\nThe total number of T-shirts and caps is 8x + 5x = 13x.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the T-shirts and caps.\nThe cost of each T-shirt is $3, so the total cost of the T-shirts is 3 * 8x = 24x.\nThe cost of each cap is $5, so the total cost of the caps is 5 * 5x = 25x.\n\nThe total cost of the T-shirts and caps is 24x + 25x = 49x.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of T-shirts and caps that Siti sold.\nSiti sold 1/4 of the T-shirts, which is 1/4 * 8x = 2x T-shirts.\nSiti sold 1/5 of the caps, which is 1/5 * 5x = x caps.\n\nThe total number of T-shirts and caps that Siti sold is 2x + x = 3x.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total amount of money Siti collected from the items she sold.\nThe total amount of money collected is the cost of the T-shirts and caps sold multiplied by the number of items sold.\nSo, the total amount of money collected is 3x * (3 + 5) = 3x * 8 = 24x.\n\nWe are given that Siti collected $132 for the items she sold.\nTherefore, we can set up the equation 24x = 132.\n\nLet's solve for x:\nDivide both sides of the equation by 24: x = 132 / 24 = 5.5.\n\nSince the number of T-shirts and caps must be a whole number, we can round x down to the nearest whole number.\nTherefore, Siti had 5 T-shirts at first.\n\nThe value of x is 5.The answer is: 5"}

Let's call the number of candies she had \"x\".\n\nDonna kept half of the number of candies plus 3 candies, so she kept $\\frac{x}{2} + 3$ candies.\n\nShe gave the remaining candies to Jane, so Jane received $x - (\\frac{x}{2} + 3)$ candies.\n\nJane ate $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the candies plus 4 candies, so she ate $\\frac{x - (\\frac{x}{2} + 3)}{3} + 4$ candies.\n\nJane gave the remaining candies to Kate, so Kate received $x - (\\frac{x}{2} + 3) - (\\frac{x - (\\frac{x}{2} + 3)}{3} + 4)$ candies.\n\nKate ate $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the candies, so she ate $\\frac{x - (\\frac{x}{2} + 3) - (\\frac{x - (\\frac{x}{2} + 3)}{3} + 4)}{4}$ candies.\n\nKate had 42 candies left, so we can set up the equation $\\frac{x -

How many pieces of candy did they have in total originally? \n\nLet $x$ be the number of pieces of candy that Rachel originally had.\nThen Alice originally had $\\frac{3x-10}{10}$ pieces of candy.\nAfter Rachel gives Alice $10$ pieces of candy, Rachel has $x-10$ pieces of candy and Alice has $\\frac{3x-10+10}{10}=3x-10$ pieces of candy.\nWe are given that Rachel has $4$ more than $3$ times as many pieces of candy that Alice has, so we have the equation $x-10=3(3x-10)+4$.\nSimplifying, we get $x-10=9x-30+4$ and $8x=24$, so $x=3$.\nTherefore, Rachel originally had $3$ pieces of candy and Alice originally had $\\frac{3(3)-10}{10}=\\frac{9}{10}$ pieces of candy.\nIn total, they originally had $3+\\frac{9}{10}=\\frac{30}{10}+\\frac{9}{10}=\\boxed{4}$ pieces of candy.The answer is: 4"}

Justin and William each answers $10$ questions and together get $96$ points. If Justin gets $24$ more points than William, how many questions does William answer correctly? \n\n\n\n\nLet's solve this problem step by step.\nFirst, we need to determine the number of correct answers and wrong answers for each person.\nSince Justin gets $24$ more points than William, we can assume that Justin gets $x$ more points than William.\nLet's say William gets $y$ points. Then Justin gets $y+x$ points.\nSince there are $10$ questions, Justin can get a maximum of $10(y+x)$ points.\nWilliam can get a maximum of $10y$ points.\nSince they together get $96$ points, we can set up the equation:\n$10y + 10(y+x) = 96$\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n$10y + 10y + 10x = 96$\n$20y + 10x = 96$\n$20y = 96 - 10x$\n$y = \\frac{96 - 10x}{20}$\nSince there are $10$ questions, William can get a maximum of $10y$ points.\nTherefore, William can get a maximum of $10\\left(\\frac{96 - 10x}{20}\\right)$ points.\nSince Justin gets $24$ more points than William, we can assume that Justin gets $10y + 24$ points.\nTherefore, we have the equation:\n$10y + 24 = 10\\left(\\frac{96 - 10x}{20}\\right)$\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n$10y + 24 = 5(96 - 10x)$\n$10y + 24 = 480 - 50x$\n$10y = 480 - 50x - 24$\n$10y = 456 - 50x$\n$y = \\frac{456 - 50x}{10}$\nSince Justin and William each answer $10$ questions, we can determine the number of correct answers and wrong answers for each person.\nFor Justin, the number of correct answers and wrong answers is equal to $10y$.\nFor William, the number of correct answers and wrong answers is equal to $y$.\nSince there are $10$ questions, Justin can get a maximum of $10(10y) = 100y$ points.\nTherefore, we have the equation:\n$100y = 100\\left(\\frac{456 - 50x}{10}\\right)$\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n$100y = 45600 - 500x$\n$100y = 45600 - 500x$\n$y = \\frac{45600 - 500x}{100}$\nWe are given that Justin and William together get $96$ points.\nTherefore, we have the equation:\n$100y + y = 96$\n$101y = 96$\n$y = \\frac{96}{101}$\n$y = \\frac{16}{17}$\nSince there are $10$ questions, William can get a maximum of $10y$ points.\nTherefore, we have the equation:\n$10y = 10\\left(\\frac{16}{17}\\right)$\n$10y = \\frac{160}{17}$\n$y = \\frac{160}{17}$\nSince Justin gets $24$ more points than William, we can assume that Justin gets $10y + 24$ points.\nTherefore, we have the equation:\n$10y + 24 = 10\\left(\\frac{160}{17}\\right)$\n$10y + 24 = \\frac{1600}{17}$\n$10y = \\frac{1600}{17} - 24$\n$10y = \\frac{1576}{17}$\n$y = \\frac{1576}{17 \\cdot 10}$\n$y = \\frac{1576}{170}$\nTherefore, William answers $\\frac{1576}{170}$ questions correctly.\n\nThe value of unknown variable $x$ is $\\frac{1576}{170}$.The answer is: 170"}

", "answer": "A teacher is distributing $$80$$ apples to the students in her class. At least one student gets at least $$3$$ apples. How big is the class? \n\nWe can solve this problem using a technique called \"greedy algorithm.\"\nFirst, we distribute the apples to the students in increasing order.\nSince at least one student gets at least three apples, we know that the remaining apples will be distributed among the other students.\nLet's say that after distributing the apples, there are $x$ apples left.\nThen, the number of students in the class is $80 - x$.\nSince at least one student gets at least three apples, we know that $80 - x \\geq 1$.\nSimplifying this inequality, we get $x \\leq 79$.\nSince each student gets a certain number of apples, the remaining apples must be distributed among the students in a way that each student gets a different number of apples.\nThis means that the number of remaining apples must be a positive integer.\nThe only positive integer less than or equal to $79$ that satisfies this condition is $1$.\nTherefore, the number of students in the class is $80 - 1 = \\boxed{79}$.\nThe answer is: 79"}

If the volume of the prism is $480\\text{cm}^{3}$, what is the height of the prism? \nThe volume of a rectangular prism is given by the formula $V = lwh$, where $l$ is the length, $w$ is the width, and $h$ is the height.\nIn this case, the length and width of the prism are both $5\\text{cm}$, so we have $V = 5\\text{cm}\\times5\\text{cm}\\timesh$.\nWe also know that there is a $1\\text{cm}\\times1\\text{cm}$ square hole cut through vertically, so the height of the prism is $h - 1\\text{cm}$.\nPlugging in the values, we have $480\\text{cm}^{3} = 5\\text{cm}\\times5\\text{cm}\\times(h - 1\\text{cm})$.\nSimplifying, we get $480 = 25(h - 1)$.\nDividing both sides by 25, we have $1920 = h - 1$.\nAdding 1 to both sides, we get $h = \\boxed{1921}$.\nThe answer is: 1921"}

Owen bought some pencils and Oscar bought some pens. If Owen wants to trade a pen from Oscar, how many pencils should Owen give Oscar? \n\nSince Owen bought pencils and Oscar bought pens, the total cost of the pencils Owen bought is $5x$ dollars and the total cost of the pens Oscar bought is $15y$ dollars. \n\nWe want to find the value of $x$ in terms of $y$. \n\nSince Owen wants to trade a pen from Oscar, the total cost of the pencils Owen gave Oscar should be equal to the total cost of the pens Oscar bought. \n\nSo we have the equation $5x = 15y$. \n\nSolving for $x$, we find $x = \\frac{15y}{5} = \\boxed{3y}$. \n\nTherefore, Owen should give Oscar 3 pencils.The answer is: 3"}

How much money did she have at first? \n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\nBud spent $$\\frac{1}{3}$$ of her money on a book, so she had $$3/3=\\frac{3}{3}$$ of her money remaining.\n\nShe then spent $$\\frac{2}{5}$$ of the remaining money on a bag, so she had $$5/5-\\frac{2}{5}=\\frac{3}{5}$$ of her money remaining.\n\nThe bag cost £$$120$$, so $$\\frac{3}{5}$$ of her money is equal to £$$120$$.\n\nLet's set up an equation to solve for her initial amount of money:\n\n$$\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot x = 120$$\n\nwhere x is her initial amount of money.\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $$\\frac{5}{3}$$ to isolate x:\n\n$$x = 120\\cdot \\frac{5}{3}$$\n\nSimplifying, we find that x = 200.\n\nTherefore, Bud had £$$200$$ at first.\n\nThe answer is: 200"}

Let $b$ represent the number of boys, $g$ represent the number of girls, and $a$ represent the number of adults. We are given that there were $\\frac{2}{7}$ as many boys as girls, so we have the equation $b = \\frac{2}{7}g$. We are also given that there were $\\frac{2}{3}$ as many adults as children, so we have the equation $a = \\frac{2}{3}b$. Finally, we are given that there were $1228$ more adults than boys, so we have the equation $a = b + 1228$. \n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the value of $b$. Substituting the first equation into the third equation, we have $a = \\frac{2}{3}(\\frac{2}{7}g) + 1228$.

If Mochi scored $264$ marks in total, how many questions did Mochi answer correctly? \n\nLet's solve this problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many marks Mochi got for the unanswered questions.\nSince there are $90$ questions in total and Mochi scored $264$ marks, the marks for the unanswered questions would be $264 - (60\\% \\times 90) = 264 - 54 = 210$.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many marks Mochi got for the correct answers.\nSince Mochi answered $60\\%$ of the questions correctly, the marks for the correct answers would be $5 \\times (60\\% \\times 90) = 5 \\times 54 = 270$.\n\nFinally, we need to find out how many questions Mochi answered correctly.\nSince the total marks for the correct answers and unanswered questions add up to $264$, we can set up the equation $270 + 210 = 264$.\nSimplifying the equation, we get $480 = 264$.\nDividing both sides by $4$, we find that Mochi answered $\\boxed{63}$ questions correctly.\n\nThe answer is: 63"}

The entire duration of Sports Day, from the start of the first activity to the end of the last activity, is $$8$$ hours and $$20$$ minutes. How many activities are there in Sports Day? \n\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\nFirst, we need to convert the time duration to minutes. \n8 hours is equal to 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.\nSo the total duration of Sports Day is 480 + 20 = 500 minutes.\nNext, we need to determine how many 45-minute activities can fit into the total duration.\n500 minutes divided by 45 minutes per activity equals 11 activities.\nHowever, we also need to consider the 20-minute break between each activity.\nSo we need to subtract the total break time from the total duration.\nThe total break time is 20 minutes per activity, multiplied by the number of activities.\n20 minutes per activity * 11 activities = 220 minutes.\nSubtracting the total break time from the total duration, we get 500 minutes - 220 minutes = 280 minutes.\nFinally, we need to determine how many 20-minute activities can fit into the remaining time.\n280 minutes divided by 20 minutes per activity equals 14 activities.\nTherefore, there are 11 activities + 14 activities = 25 activities in Sports Day.\nThe answer is: 25"}

Eliza sold twice as many cookies as Veron. Betty sold $$185$$ fewer cookies than Eliza. How many cookies did Betty sell? \n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that Eliza sold twice as many cookies as Veron. Let's say Veron sold X cookies. Therefore, Eliza sold 2X cookies.\n\nNext, we know that Betty sold $185 fewer cookies than Eliza. Therefore, Betty sold 2X - $185 cookies.\n\nWe also know that the total number of cookies sold is $855. So we can set up the equation: X + 2X + (2X - $185) = $855.\n\nCombining like terms, we get 5X - $185 = $855.\n\nAdding $185 to both sides, we get 5X = $1040.\n\nDividing both sides by 5, we get X = $208.\n\nSo Veron sold 208 cookies.\n\nAnd Betty sold 2X - $185 = 2(208) - $185 = 416 - $185 = 231 cookies.\n\nTherefore, Betty sold 231 cookies.\n\nThe value of x is 208.The answer is: 208"}

", "answer": "The sum of the digits of a 2-digit number is 15. What is the smallest possible such 2-digit number? \nThe smallest 2-digit number is 10, and the sum of its digits is 1.\nTo find the smallest 2-digit number with a digit sum of 15, we start with the smallest possible digits, which are 0 and 1.\nWe can try different combinations of these digits to see if the sum is 15.\nIf we have a 2-digit number with digits 0 and 1, the sum of the digits is 1 + 0 + 1 = 2, which is not equal to 15.\nWe can try the next combination, which is 1 and 4. The sum of the digits is 1 + 4 + 0 = 5, which is still not equal to 15.\nWe continue trying different combinations until we find one that satisfies the condition.\nThe next combination is 2 and 3. The sum of the digits is 2 + 3 + 0 = 5, which is still not equal to 15.\nThe next combination is 3 and 2. The sum of the digits is 3 + 2 + 0 = 5, which is still not equal to 15.\nThe next combination is 4 and 1.

We want to choose $5$ students from a group of $15$, so we have $\\binom{15}{5}$ ways to do this. \n\nHowever, we need to account for the fact that exactly one of A, B, or C is chosen. We can do this by considering the number of ways to choose $1$ student from group A, $1$ student from group B, and $3$ students from group C, and then subtracting the number of ways to choose $1$ student from group A, $1$ student from group B, and $2$ students from group C. \n\nThe number of ways to choose $1$ student from group A is $\\binom{5}{1}$, the number of ways to choose $1$ student from group B is $\\binom{5}{1}$, and the number of ways to choose $3$ students from group C is $\\binom{5}{3}$. \n\nThe number of ways to choose $1$ student from group A, $1$ student from group B, and $2$ students from group C is $\\binom{5}{1} \\cdot \\binom{5}{1} \\cdot \\binom{5}{2}$, and the number of ways to choose $1$ student from group A, $1$ student from group B, and $1$ student from group C is $\\binom{5}{1} \\cdot \\binom{5}{1} \\cdot \\binom{5}{1}$. \n\nTherefore, the number of different ways to choose the students is $\\binom{15}{5} - \\binom{5}{1} \\cdot \\binom{5}{1} \\cdot \\binom{5}{2} + \\binom{5}{1} \\cdot \\binom{5}{1} \\cdot \\binom{5}{1} = 455 - 120 + 120 = \\boxed{395}$.The answer is: 395"}

", "answer": "Frank is older than Alex who is older than Paul. If the difference in age between Frank and Alex is the same as the difference in age between Alex and Paul, and their sum of ages is $$99$$, How old is Alex? \n\nWe can set up the following equation based on the given information:\nFrank's age - Alex's age = Alex's age - Paul's age\nFrank's age - Alex's age = Paul's age - Alex's age\nLet's assign variables to each person's age:\nLet Frank's age be F, Alex's age be A, and Paul's age be P.\nWe can now rewrite the equation as:\nF - A = A - P\nF - A = P - A\nWe know that the sum of their ages is 99, so:\nF + A + P = 99\nNow we have a system of equations:\nF - A = P - A\nF + A + P = 99\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of F, A, and P.\nAdding the two equations together, we get:\n2F = 2P\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n2F + A + P = 99\nF + A + (2P - A) = 99\nF + 2P = 99\nWe also know that the difference in age between Frank and Alex is the same as the difference in age between Alex and Paul:\nF - A = P - A\nF - A = A - P\nF - A = P - A\nF = 2A\nSubstituting this into the equation F + 2P = 99, we get:\n2A + 2P = 99\nSince we want to find the age of Alex (A), we need to solve for A.\nSubstituting A = 2P - 2A into the equation F + A + P = 99, we get:\nF + (2P - 2A) + P = 99\nF + 3P - 2A = 99\nSince F = 2A, we can substitute this into the equation:\n2A + 3P - 2A = 99\n3P = 99\nP = 33\nSubstituting P = 33 into the equation A = 2P - 2A, we get:\nA = 2(33) - 2A\nA = 66 - 2A\n3A = 66\nA = 22\nSo, Alex is 22 years old.The answer is: 22"}

After $$60$$ boys and $$12$$ girls left the gathering, there were twice as many girls as boys who remained at the gathering. Find the number of boys at the gathering at first. \n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\nAfter 60 boys and 12 girls left the gathering, there were twice as many girls as boys who remained at the gathering.\nLet's assume the number of boys at the gathering at first is x.\nSo, the number of girls at the gathering at first is also x.\nAfter 60 boys and 12 girls left the gathering, the number of boys remaining is x - 60 and the number of girls remaining is 2(x - 60).\nAccording to the given information, the number of girls remaining is twice the number of boys remaining, so we can write the equation: 2(x - 60) = x - 60.\nSimplifying the equation, we get: 2x - 120 = x - 60.\nBringing like terms to one side, we get: x = 60.\nTherefore, the number of boys at the gathering at first is 60.\nThe value of x is 60.The answer is: 60"}

How many lemons did Rena buy? \n\nWe can set up the equation: $$\\frac{2}{3}x + \\frac{1}{9}x + y = 12$$\nwhere $x$ represents the number of apples, $y$ represents the number of lemons, and $12$ represents the difference between the number of apples and lemons.\n\nWe can simplify the equation by multiplying each fraction by the least common denominator, which is $9$:\n$$\\frac{6}{9}x + \\frac{1}{9}x + y = 12$$\n\nCombining like terms, we have:\n$$\\frac{7}{9}x + y = 12$$\n\nSince we know that the total number of items is $12$, we can set up the equation:\n$$x + y + 12 = 12$$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n$$x + y = 0$$\n\nNow we have a system of equations:\n$$\\begin{cases} \\frac{7}{9}x + y = 12 \\\\ x + y = 0 \\end{cases}$$\n\nWe can solve this system of equations by subtracting the second equation from the first equation:\n$$\\frac{7}{9}x - x + y - y = 12 - 0$$\n$$\\frac{7}{9}x - x = 12$$\n$$-\\frac{2}{9}x = 12$$\n$$x = -\\frac{12}{2/9}$$\n$$x = -\\frac{12}{2/9} \\cdot \\frac{9}{1} = -\\frac{12 \\cdot 9}{2} = -36$$\n\nSince we know that the number of lemons cannot be negative, we made an error in our calculations. Let's try again.\n\nWe know that Rena bought $$12$$ more apples than lemons, so we can set up the equation:\n$$\\frac{2}{3}x + \\frac{1}{9}x + y = 12$$\n$$\\frac{2}{3}x + \\frac{1}{9}x + (-\\frac{12}{2/9}x) = 12$$\n$$\\frac{2}{3}x + \\frac{1}{9}x -

Brad bought 4 mangoes, 2 pears and an apple for £13.20. Find the cost of a mango. \n\n#### 1.1\nThe cost of a mango can be found by subtracting the cost of a pear from the total cost of a mango and a pear, and then subtracting the cost of an apple from the total cost of a mango and an apple. \n\nLet's denote the cost of a mango as M and the cost of a pear as P. \n\nFrom the given information, we have the following equations:\nM + P = 3.40\nM + A = 3.80\n\nWe also know that Brad bought 4 mangoes, 2 pears, and 1 apple for a total of £13.20. So we have:\n4M + 2P + A = 13.20\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of M and P. \n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:\nM - A = 0.40\n\nAdding this equation to the third equation, we get:\n4M + 2P + A - (M - A) = 13.20\n5M + P = 13.20\n\nSubstituting the value of M from the first equation into the second equation, we get:\nP = 3.40 - 0.40\nP = 3.00\n\nSubstituting the value of P into the third equation, we get:\n5M + 3.00 = 13.20\n5M = 10.20\nM = 2.04\n\nTherefore, the cost of a mango is £2.04.The answer is: 2.04"}

The cost of each table was the total cost of $$3$$ such chairs.

How much pocket money did Pip have to begin with? \n\n\n\n\nLet's solve this problem using a case study. \nPip has 50 more than Bud, so let's say Bud has x amount of money. \nPip then has x + 50.\nWhen Pip spends 80% of his money, he has 20% left, which is 0.2 times his original amount. \nSo Pip has 0.2(x + 50) left.\nWhen Bud spends 3/4 of her money, she has 1/4 left, which is 0.25 times her original amount. \nSo Bud has 0.25x left.\nThe ratio of Pip's leftover money to Bud's leftover money is 6:5. \nSo we can set up the equation: \n0.2(x + 50) / 0.25x = 6/5\nSimplifying, we get: \n(x + 50) / 0.25x = 6/5\nCross multiplying, we get: \n5(x + 50) = 6(0.25x)\nExpanding, we get: \n5x + 250 = 1.5x\nSubtracting 1.5x from both sides, we get: \n3.5x = 250\nDividing both sides by 3.5, we get: \nx = 70\nSo Bud has 70 units of money. \nSince Pip has 50 more than Bud, Pip has 70 + 50 = 120 units of money. \nTherefore, Pip had 120 units of money to begin with. \nThe answer is: 120"}

If the bag contains £$$15.75$$, haw many $$20\\text{p}$$ coins are there? \n\nLet's solve this problem step by step.\n\nWe know that the bag contains £$$15.75$$.\nWe also know that there are twice as many $$20\\text{p}$$ coins as $$10\\text{p}$$ coins, and half as many $$5\\text{p}$$ coins as $$10\\text{p}$$ coins.\n\nLet's say the number of $$10\\text{p}$$ coins is x.

How many chickens are there in the barn? \nThere are 8 cows, and each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs for the cows is 8 * 4 = 32 legs.\nIf the total number of legs for all the cows and chickens is 26, then the number of legs for the chickens is 26 - 32 = -6 legs.\nSince each chicken has 2 legs, the number of chickens in the barn is -6 / 2 = -3 chickens.\nHowever, since we can't have a negative number of chickens, we know that there are 3 chickens in the barn.\nTherefore, the answer is 3.\n#### 3\nThe answer is: 3"}

Then the number of women is $4x$.\nAccording to the problem, $4x = x + 126$.\nSimplifying the equation, we get $3x = 126$.\nDividing both sides by 3, we find $x = 42$.\nSo the number of men is 42, and the number of women is $4(42) = 168$.\nTherefore, the total number of people in the concert hall is $42 + 168 = \\boxed{210}$.The answer is: 210"}

Let's represent Louise's age as L and Andrew's age as A.\nWe know that Andrew is three times as old as Louise, so we can write the equation A = 3L.\nWe also know that the sum of their ages is $84, so we can write the equation L + A = 84.\nSubstituting the value of A from the first equation into the second equation, we get L + 3L = 84.\nCombining like terms, we get 4L = 84.\nDividing both sides by 4, we get L = 21.\nTherefore, Louise is 21 years old.\n#### 21\nThe answer is: 21"}

There is an equal number of boys and girls who cannot swim.  How many pupils are there in the class? \n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\nLet's assume the total number of pupils in the class is $x$.\nSince there are an equal number of boys and girls who cannot swim, let's say there are $y$ boys and $y$ girls who cannot swim.\nWe know that $\\frac{3}{8}$ of the girls can swim, so the number of girls who can swim is $\\frac{3}{8} \\cdot y$.\nWe also know that $\\frac{3}{5}$ of the boys can swim, so the number of boys who can swim is $\\frac{3}{5} \\cdot y$.\nThe total number of pupils who can swim is the sum of the number of girls and boys who can swim, which is $\\frac{3}{8} \\cdot y + \\frac{3}{5} \\cdot y$.\nWe are given that the total number of pupils who cannot swim is 20, so we have the equation $y + y = 20$.\nSimplifying this equation, we get $2y = 20$, which means $y = 10$.\nSubstituting this value back into the equation for the total number of pupils who can swim, we get $\\frac{3}{8} \\cdot 10 + \\frac{3}{5} \\cdot 10 = \\frac{30}{8} + \\frac{30}{5} = \\frac{30}{8} + \\frac{60}{8} = \\frac{90}{8} = 11.25$.\nSince the total number of pupils in the class cannot be a decimal, we can conclude that there are 11 pupils in the class.\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{11}$.The answer is: 11"}

This means that the actual journey time is $$x + \\frac{15}{60}$$ hours. \nSetting these two expressions for the actual journey time equal to each other, we have: \n$$x + \\frac{5}{60} = x + \\frac{15}{60}$$\nSubtracting $$x$$ from both sides, we have: \n$$\\frac{5}{60} = \\frac{15}{60} - x$$\nSubtracting $$\\frac{15}{60}$$ from both sides, we have: \n$$\\frac{5}{60} - \\frac{15}{60} = -x$$\nSimplifying, we have: \n$$\\frac{-10}{60} = -x$$\nDividing both sides by -10, we have: \n$$\\frac{1}{6} = x$$\nSo, the journey should have taken 1 hour. \nHowever, we are given that the actual journey time is $$5$$ minutes late, which is equivalent to $$\\frac{5}{60}$$ hours. \nTherefore, the actual journey time is $$1 + \\frac{5}{60} = \\frac{65}{60}$$ hours. \nThe answer is: 1"}

How many minutes does he spend jogging? ", "answer": "Peter exercises for an hour every day. $$\\frac{1}{3}$$ of the time is spent cycling and the rest of the time is spent jogging. How many minutes does he spend jogging? \n\n\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the value of x, which represents the number of minutes Peter spends jogging.\nWe know that Peter exercises for an hour every day, which is equivalent to 60 minutes.\nHe spends 1/3 of the time cycling, so he spends 1/3 * 60 = 20 minutes cycling.\nThe remaining time is spent jogging, so he spends 60 - 20 = 40 minutes jogging.\nTherefore, the value of x is 40. Peter spends 40 minutes jogging.The answer is: 40"}

How many apples does Anne have? \n\nWe can solve this problem by setting up an equation. Let's represent the number of apples Anne has as $x$.\nMaria has $x+20$ apples.\nAltogether, they have $x+(x+20)=44$ apples.\nCombining like terms, we get $2x+20=44$.\nSubtracting $20$ from both sides, we get $2x=24$.\nDividing both sides by $2$, we get $x=12$.\nTherefore, Anne has $\\boxed{12}$ apples.The answer is: 12"}

How many coins did Owen have at first? \nLet $x$ be the number of fifty-cent coins Owen had initially. Then the number of one-dollar coins he had initially is $\\frac{2}{7}x$. \nHis mother gave him $10$ one-dollar coins, so the total number of one-dollar coins he had is $\\frac{2}{7}x + 10$. \nShe also gave him $5$ fifty-cent coins, so the total number of fifty-cent coins he had is $x + 5$. \nAccording to the problem, Owen had twice as many one-dollar coins as fifty-cent coins, so we have the equation $\\frac{2}{7}x + 10 = 2(x + 5)$. \nSimplifying this equation, we get $\\frac{2}{7}x + 10 = 2x + 10$. \nMultiplying both sides by $7$ to eliminate the fraction, we get $2x + 70 = 14x + 70$. \nSubtracting $2x$ and $70$ from both sides, we get $0 = 12x$. \nSince $x$ cannot be $0$, this implies that Owen had $\\boxed{12}$ coins initially.The answer is: 12"}

There is also a fixed service fee of $$4$$ dollars. How many tons of water can she use for $$109$$ dollars at most? \nWe can solve this problem by setting up an inequality. \nLet $x$ represent the number of tons of water Irene can use. \nThe total cost is given by $4x + 3(4) + 4$. \nWe want to find the maximum value of $x$ such that $4x + 3(4) + 4 \\leq 109$. \nSimplifying the inequality gives $4x + 12 + 4 \\leq 109$. \nCombining like terms gives $4x + 16 \\leq 109$. \nSubtracting 16 from both sides gives $4x \\leq 93$. \nDividing both sides by 4 gives $x \\leq 23.25$. \nSince $x$ represents the number of tons, we can round down to the nearest whole number. \nTherefore, Irene can use a maximum of $\\boxed{23}$ tons of water.The answer is: 23"}

They had $$6230$$ cookies in total. How many cookies did $$Daniel$$ have? \n\n\n\nWe can solve this problem using a combination of algebraic manipulation and logical reasoning.\n\nLet's break down the information given:\nNumber of cookies Amelia had: 160\nNumber of cookies Bala had: 320 more than Daniel\nNumber of cookies Carl had: 1/2 as many as Amelia, Bala, and Daniel\nNumber of cookies Daniel had:?\nTotal number of cookies: 6230\n\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\nNumber of cookies Amelia had + Number of cookies Bala had + Number of cookies Carl had + Number of cookies Daniel had = Total number of cookies\n160 + (160 + 320) + (1/2)(160 + (160 + 320)) + (1/2)(160 + (160 + 320)) = 6230\n\nLet's simplify and solve for Daniel:\n160 + 480 + (1/2)(720) + (1/2)(720) = 6230\n160 + 480 + 360 + 360 = 6230\n1200 = 6230\n\nTo isolate Daniel, we subtract 1200 from both sides of the equation:\n1200 - 1200 + 360 + 360 = 6230 - 1200\n720 = 5030\n\nFinally, we divide both sides of the equation by 720 to solve for Daniel:\n720 / 720 = 5030 / 720\n1 = 7\n\nTherefore, Daniel had 7 cookies.\nThe value of x is 7.The answer is: 7"}

When 240 more cows and goats were added to the farm, the percentage of cows increased by 20\\% and the number of goats doubled. How many goats were there in the farm at first? ", "answer": "65\\%~ ~65\\% of the animals in a farm were cows and the rest were goats. When 240 more cows and goats were added to the farm, the percentage of cows increased by 20\\% and the number of goats doubled. How many goats were there in the farm at first? \n\nLet's solve this problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the percentage of cows in the farm. We know that 65% of the animals were cows, so the percentage of cows is 65%.\n\nNext, we need to determine the percentage increase in the percentage of cows. We know that the increase is 20%, so the new percentage of cows is 65% + 20% = 85%.\n\nWe also know that the number of goats doubled after adding 240 more cows and goats. So, the number of goats before the addition was 240/2 = 120.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of animals in the farm before the addition. We know that the percentage of cows is 65% and the percentage of goats is 100% - 65% = 35%.\n\nLet's assume the total number of animals in the farm is x. Therefore, the number of cows is 65% of x, which is 0.65x. And the number of goats is 35% of x, which is 0.35x.\n\nWe can set up the equation: 0.65x + 0.35x = x - 240.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get: 1.0x = x - 240.\n\nSubtracting x from both sides, we get: 0.0x = -240.\n\nDividing both sides by 0, we get: x = -240.\n\nSince the number of animals cannot be negative, we can conclude that there were no animals in the farm before the addition.\n\nTherefore, the number of goats in the farm at first is 120.\n\nThe value of unknown variable x is -240.\n\nThe value of unknown variable x is -240.The answer is: 240"}

There is now an equal number of men and women still waiting at the bus stop. How many people in total were there at the bus stop at first? \n\nLet's solve this problem using a diagram. Let's say there were $x$ men and $y$ women at the bus stop initially.\n\nAfter the first bus arrived, there were $x-36$ men and $y+36$ women remaining.\n\nThe number of women at the bus stop became $\\frac{3}{5}$ of the number of men, so we have the equation $y+36 = \\frac{3}{5}(x-36)$.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get $y = \\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{108}{5}$.\n\nThe second bus arrived and 48 men boarded it, so there are now $x-48$ men and $y+48$ women remaining.\n\nSince there is an equal number of men and women still waiting at the bus stop, we have the equation $x-48 = y+48$.\n\nSolving this equation, we get $x = 2y+96$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $x$ into the equation $y = \\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{108}{5}$, we get $y = \\frac{3}{5}(2y+96) - \\frac{108}{5}$.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get $y = \\frac{6}{5}y + \\frac{144}{5} - \\frac{108}{5}$.\n\nCombining like terms, we get $y = \\frac{6}{5}y + \\frac{36}{5}$.\n\nSubtracting $\\frac{6}{5}y$ from both sides, we get $\\frac{1}{5}y = \\frac{36}{5}$.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 5, we get $\\frac{1}{5}y \\cdot 5 = \\frac{36}{5} \\cdot 5$.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get $y = 36$.\n\nSubstituting this value of $y$ into the equation $x = 2y+96$, we get $x = 2(36)+96$.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get $x = 72+96$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people at the bus stop initially is $x+y = 72+96 = \\boxed{178}$.The answer is: 178"}

The common difference is $4-2=2$.\n\nWe can see that the terms form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $2$.\nTo find the number of terms, we can use the formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence: $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$,\nwhere $a_n$ is the $n$th term, $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the number of terms, and $d$ is the common difference.\nIn this case, $a_1 = 2$ and $d = 2$.\nWe want to find $n$ when $a_n = 240$.\nSo we have $240 = 2 + (n-1)(2)$.\nSimplifying, we get $240 = 2 + 2n - 2$.\nCombining like terms, we have $240 = 2n$.\nDividing both sides by $2$, we get $120 = n$.\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{120}$ terms in the sequence.The answer is: 120"}

Altogether they have $$44$$ apples. How many apples does Anne have?（Adapted from $$2005$$ Math Kangaroo Problem, Levels $$1-2$$, Question \\#$$15$$） \n\nWe can solve this problem by setting up an equation based on the given information.\nLet's represent the number of apples Anne has as $a$.\nMaria has $20$ apples more than Anne, so Maria has $a+20$ apples.\nAltogether, they have $44$ apples, so we can write the equation:\n$a + (a+20) = 44$\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n$2a + 20 = 44$\nSubtracting $20$ from both sides, we get:\n$2a = 24$\nDividing both sides by $2$, we get:\n$a = 12$\nTherefore, Anne has $\\boxed{12}$ apples.\nThe answer is: 12"}

If he gives $$13$$ stickers to each pupil, he will have an excess of $$190$$ stickers. If he gives $$17$$ stickers to each pupil, he will have an excess of $$50$$ stickers. How many stickers does Mr Ya have? \n\nWe can solve this problem using a system of equations.\nLet $x$ represent the number of stickers Mr. Ya has.\nFrom the first statement, we have the equation $13x = 190$.\nFrom the second statement, we have the equation $17x = 50$.\nWe can solve this system of equations by multiplying the second equation by 13 and subtracting it from the first equation:\n$13x - 13(17x) = 190 - 13(50)$\n$13x - 221x = 190 - 650$\n$-221x = -460$\n$x = \\frac{-460}{-221}$\n$x = \\frac{200}{11}$\n$x \\approx \\boxed{19}$.\nTherefore, Mr. Ya has approximately 19 stickers.The answer is: 19"}

Find the total number of students left in the hall at the end. \n\nThe total number of students in the hall initially is $65$ more than the number of boys, so let's call this number $x$. \n\nThen the number of boys is $x - 65$, and the number of girls is $x + 65$.\n\nAfter $\\frac{2}{5}$ of the boys and $\\frac{3}{7}$ of the girls left for recess, the number of boys remaining is $\\frac{4}{5}(x - 65)$, and the number of girls remaining is $\\frac{4}{7}(x + 65)$.\n\nSince the number of boys and girls remaining is equal, we have $\\frac{4}{5}(x - 65) = \\frac{4}{7}(x + 65)$.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get $\\frac{4}{5}x - \\frac{4}{5}(65) = \\frac{4}{7}x + \\frac{4}{7}(65)$.\n\nMultiplying both sides by $35$ to clear the fractions, we have $14x - 240 = 35x + 260$.\n\nSimplifying further, we get $21x = 500$, so $x = 25$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of students initially in the hall is $x + 65 = 25 + 65 = 90$.\n\nSince $\\frac{4}{5}$ of the boys and $\\frac{3}{7}$ of the girls left for recess, the number of students remaining in the hall is $\\frac{3}{5}(x - 65) + \\frac{4}{7}(x + 65) = \\frac{3}{5}(25 - 65) + \\frac{4}{7}(25 + 65) = \\frac{3}{5}(-40) + \\frac{4}{7}(100) = -24 + 50 = \\boxed{26}$.\n\nThe answer is: 26"}

If Johnson gives vicky $$8$$ coins, Vicky will still have $$2$$ fewer coins than Johnson. How many coins does Johnson have to start with? \n\nLet's solve this problem using a diagram.\nLet's say Johnson has $x$ coins.\nAfter Johnson gives Vicky 8 coins, Johnson will have $x-8$ coins.\nVicky will have $2$ fewer coins than Johnson, so Vicky will have $(x-8)-2$ coins.\nWe are given that Vicky and Johnson together have $48$ coins, so we can write the equation:\n$(x-8)-(x-8)+2=48$\nSimplifying, we get:\n$2=48$\nThis is not possible, so there must be an error in the problem or the diagram.\nPlease double-check the problem or provide more information.The answer is: 48"}

What is the total number of cupcakes and muffins Demi had at first? \n\nLet's say Demi had $x$ cupcakes and $y$ muffins at first.\nAfter selling $60$ cupcakes and $12$ muffins, the number of cupcakes left is $x-60$ and the number of muffins left is $y-12$.\nWe are given that the number of muffins left is twice the number of cupcakes left, so we have the equation $y-12=2(x-60)$.\nExpanding and simplifying, we get $y-12=2x-120$.\nBringing like terms to one side, we get $2x-y=120$.\nSince we are looking for the total number of cupcakes and muffins at first, we need to find the value of $x+y$.\nWe can solve the equation $2x-y=120$ for $y$ in terms of $x$ by adding $y$ to both sides, resulting in $y=2x-120$.\nSubstituting this expression for $y$ into the equation $x+y=120$, we get $x+(2x-120)=120$.\nSimplifying, we get $3x-120=120$.\nAdding $120$ to both sides, we get $3x=240$.\nDividing both sides by $3$, we get $x=80$.\nSubstituting this value of $x$ into the equation $y=2x-120$, we get $y=2(80)-120=160-120=40$.\nTherefore, the total number of cupcakes and muffins Demi had at first is $x+y=80+40=\\boxed{120}$.\nThe answer is: 120"}

", "answer": "How many 0s are there at the end of the product $$75\\times56\\times12\\times105$$? \n\nWe can find the number of 0s at the end of the product by counting the number of factors of 10 in the product.\nSince 10 is equal to $2\\times5$, we need to count the number of factors of 2 and 5 in the product.\nIn the given product, there are more factors of 2 than factors of 5, so we just need to count the number of factors of 5.\nThere is one factor of 5 in each multiple of 5, two factors of 5 in each multiple of 25, and three factors of 5 in each multiple of 125.\nIn the given product, there are $75/5=15$ multiples of 5, $75/25=3$ multiples of 25, and $75/125=0$ multiples of 125.\nTherefore, there are $15+3+0=\\boxed{18}$ factors of 5 in the product, and thus there are 18 0s at the end of the product.\nThe answer is: 18"}

If the difference in age between Aaron and Becky is the same as the difference in age between Becky and Chris, and their sum of ages is $$60$$, How old is Becky? \nLet's denote the age of Aaron as $A$, the age of Becky as $B$, and the age of Caris as $C$.\nWe are given the following information:\n$A > B > C$\n$A - B = B - C$\n$A + B + C = 60$\nFrom the second equation, we can rewrite it as $A = B + C - 2$.\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we have $B + C - 2 > B > C$.\nSince $B$ and $C$ are positive integers, the only possible values for $B$ and $C$ are $1$ and $2$ in some order.\nIf $B = 1$ and $C = 2$, then $A = 3$ and $60 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6$.\nIf $B = 2$ and $C = 1$, then $A = 3$ and $60 = 2 + 1 + 3 = 6$.\nTherefore, Becky is $\\boxed{2}$ years old.The answer is: 2"}

Every day, she will use $$9$$ watermelons and $$9$$ pineapples to make fruit juice. After~\\uline{~~~~~~~~~~}~days, the number of pineapples left will be $$3$$ times of the number of watermelons left. \n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of watermelons and pineapples left after one day.\nSharon will use 9 watermelons and 9 pineapples each day, so after one day, she will have 94 - 9 = 85 watermelons left and 138 - 9 = 129 pineapples left.\n\nNext, let's find the number of pineapples left after a certain number of days.\nAfter the given number of days, the number of pineapples left will be 3 times the number of watermelons left.\nLet's say the number of days is x.\nAfter x days, Sharon will have 129 * 3 = 387 pineapples left.\n\nNow, let's set up an equation using the given information.\nWe know that Sharon will have 387 pineapples left after x days, and we also know that she will have 85 watermelons left after one day.\nSo, the equation is:\n387 = 129 * 3\n\nLet's solve for x.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 129, we get:\n3 = 3\n\nSince the equation is true, it means that the number of days is indeed x.\n\nTherefore, the value of the unknown variable x is 1.The answer is: 1"}

", "answer": "$\\tfrac{3}{4}$~of Chelsia\\textquotesingle s money is the same as~$\\tfrac{5}{6}$~of Brian\\textquotesingle s money. If Chelsia has $$$24$$ more than Brian, how much money do Chelsia and Brian have altogether? \n\nWe can set up the equation $\\frac{3}{4}x = \\frac{5}{6}y$ to represent the given information, where $x$ represents the amount of money Chelsia has and $y$ represents the amount of money Brian has.\nWe are also given that Chelsia has $24$ more than Brian, so we can write the equation $x = y + 24$.\nWe can substitute this expression for $x$ into the first equation to get $\\frac{3}{4}(y + 24) = \\frac{5}{6}y$.\nSimplifying this equation gives $\\frac{3}{4}y + \\frac{3}{4}(24) = \\frac{5}{6}y$.\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by $12$ to clear the fractions gives $9y + 18 = 5y$.\nSubtracting $5y$ from both sides of the equation gives $4y + 18 = 0$.\nSubtracting $18$ from both sides of the equation gives $4y = -18$.\nDividing both sides of the equation by $4$ gives $y = -4.5$.\nSince we know that $x = y + 24$, we can substitute the value of $y$ into this equation to get $x = -4.5 + 24$.\nSimplifying this equation gives $x = 19.5$.\nTherefore, Chelsia has $19.5$ and Brian has $-4.5$.\nAltogether, Chelsia and Brian have $19.5 + (-4.5) = \\boxed{15}$.The answer is: 15"}

If these remainders are all different, what is the smallest possible $M$? \nWe can solve this problem using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\nSince the remainders are all different, we can represent each remainder as a different integer between 0 and 10.\nLet's list out the possible remainders: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.\nNow we need to find a number $M$ that satisfies the condition.\nWe can start by setting $M$ equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of the divisors 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.\nThe LCM of these numbers is 2^3 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 = 2520.\nSo we set $M = 2520$ and check if it satisfies the condition.\nWhen we divide 2520 by 2, we get a remainder of 0.\nWhen we divide 2520 by 3, we get a remainder of 0.\nWhen we divide 2520 by 4, we get a remainder of 0.\nWhen we divide 2520 by 5, we get a remainder of 0.\nWhen we divide 2520 by 6, we get a remainder of 0.\nWhen we divide 2520 by 7, we get a remainder of 0.\nWhen we divide 2520 by 8, we get a remainder of 0.\nWhen we divide 2520 by 9, we get a remainder of 0.\nWhen we divide 2520 by 10, we get a remainder of 0.\nSo $M = 2520$ satisfies the condition.\nTherefore, the smallest possible $M$ is $\\boxed{2520}$.The answer is: 2520"}

How many poppers were left in the last bag? \nWe want to find the value of $$x$$ in the given situation.\nWe are told that Anna and Alfred bought enough bags of poppers so that all 153 guests at their birthday party could have one.\nEach bag contains 12 poppers.\nTo find the total number of poppers, we can multiply the number of bags by the number of poppers in each bag:\nTotal number of poppers = Number of bags * Number of poppers per bag\nTotal number of poppers = 12 * Number of bags\nWe are given that the total number of poppers is 153, so we can write:\n153 = 12 * Number of bags\nTo find the number of bags, we can divide both sides of the equation by 12:\nNumber of bags = 153 / 12\nNumber of bags = 13\nSince each bag contains 12 poppers, we can find the number of poppers in the last bag by subtracting the number of poppers in the previous bags from the total number of poppers:\nNumber of poppers in the last bag = Total number of poppers - (Number of bags - 1) * Number of poppers per bag\nNumber of poppers in the last bag = 153 - (13 - 1) * 12\nNumber of poppers in the last bag = 153 - 12 * 12\nNumber of poppers in the last bag = 153 - 144\nNumber of poppers in the last bag = 9\nTherefore, there were 9 poppers left in the last bag.\nThe value of x is 9.The answer is: 9"}
